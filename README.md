# MathLox0
My take on Bob Nystrom's Lox from the book Crafting Interpreters
The project is based originally on the source code from the book.It features the following addiitons:
->In built complex numbers(functions for cmplx numbers is under construction)
->In built list type thanks to the wonderful link of Caleb Schoepp Check:https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2020/adding-a-list-data-type-to-lox/ 
->In built matrix type (Note:the multiplication uses dgemm() from openblas)
->break statemennt;
++,-- preincrement operators
multiline comments
more native functions...
+=,-=,*=,/= for number types only again based on Caleb Schoepp
power operator and modulus operator
Take your time and go through the code.
